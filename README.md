### Explanation of Columns:
- **Compression**: Indicates whether the format is compressed. Lossless compression preserves the original quality, while lossy compression sacrifices some quality for a smaller file size.
- **Loss of Quality**: Some formats lose audio quality during compression, while others retain the original sound.
- **File Size**: Relative size of the files. Uncompressed formats are very large, while lossy formats reduce the size significantly.
- **Audio Quality**: The perceived audio quality. Lossless formats offer perfect audio, while lossy formats may show noticeable degradation.
- **Multi-platform Support**: Compatibility with various operating systems and devices.
- **Streaming**: Indicates if the format is commonly used for streaming, where small file sizes and decent quality are crucial.
- **Audio Editing**: Certain formats, like WAV and AIFF, are better suited for professional audio editing due to their uncompressed nature.
